## A spaced themed portfolio designed and developed by me 


### Home page:
1. Straight away, we can see my portfolio shows a space theme. It starts with the nav showing colourful buttons for the homepage, about page and contact page. It then goes down to the banner welcoming the viewer and introducing myself as well as the website. Between that and the main content we can see a floating astronaut to create a 0-gravity kind of feeling. We then reach the main content showing some of my spaced themed illustrator projects. Finally, we reach the footer where there is a logo and copywrite claims of course.

**Differences:** 
There are very few differences between the Figma prototype and the actual website for the homepage. I will explain what they are and I why I made the adjustments. First one is the hamburger menu. Originally the hamburger menu would take up the entire page but, on my website, it only slides down to display the buttons. I felt as though it had a better look to it and made it more convenient or rather less confusing for the user. The other change I made was not displaying any text under the carousel down below. I made the change because the title already indicates that this is a preview of my work. I also felt it took space and made it look more crowded than it needed to be if I added text.  


### About us page: 
2. the about us page features a picture of myself along with some text describing my skills and me as a person. Further down we can see a fun animation of a flying rocket showcasing some of my skills with animation, using css. 

**Differences:** 
There were not many differences made between the Figma prototype and the actual website as well, for the about page. I kept the space background for the text to make it so my image and the text felt like a single section rather than a separated one. I also made the rocket ship section larger because I wanted more room for it to fly around. 


### Contact page: 
3. The contact page shows an area where you can fill out your information to get in contact with me, alongside an image of a waving astronaut. Down below there are also buttons to my social media accounts. The buttons are the same style as the ones we see throughout the website. 

**Differences:**
 The main difference is the colour scheme, it is a slightly darker blue than the one used in the prototype because of the colour contrast level. I also made it so in the iPad version, the background image for the social media buttons is evenly divided because I felt as though it was more esthetically pleasing. Same went for the changes in the mobile version for the social media section. I felt as though the layout for the buttons resided better in that position. Finally, I kept the logo for the footer to keep the flow of the footer the same throughout website.
